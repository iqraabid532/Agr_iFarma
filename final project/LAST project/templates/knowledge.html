<h2>Knowledge Base</h2>
<p>Learn about modern farming practices, crop management, and sustainability.</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Organic Farming:</b> Methods and benefits.</li>
    <p>Reduces Chemical Pollution: Avoids synthetic pesticides and fertilizers, which prevents soil and water contamination.

Enhances Soil Health: Uses compost, green manure, and crop rotation, improving soil fertility and structure.

Biodiversity Conservation: Supports diverse plants, insects, and animals, creating balanced ecosystems.

Lower Carbon Footprint: Often relies on local inputs and renewable resources, reducing greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
    <li><b>Soil Testing:</b> Importance of nutrients balance.</li>
    <p>Nutrient levels (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, etc.)

Soil pH (acidity or alkalinity)

Organic matter content

Presence of contaminants or heavy metals

Cation exchange capacity (CEC) – ability of soil to hold nutrients</p>
    <li><b>Smart Irrigation:</b> Using sensors and IoT in farming.</li>
    <p>Soil Moisture Sensors: Measure water content in the soil and signal when irrigation is needed.

Weather Sensors: Track rainfall, humidity, and temperature to adjust irrigation schedules.

Automated Valves & Controllers: Turn irrigation systems on/off automatically based on sensor data.

Smart Apps & Cloud Systems: Allow remote monitoring and management, data logging, and predictive irrigation.</p>
</ul>
